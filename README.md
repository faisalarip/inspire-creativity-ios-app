# Stagger — SwiftUI Animation Catalog

A native iOS 17+ SwiftUI port of the Stagger animation catalog prototype. Browse, preview, and buy hand-crafted SwiftUI animations.

## Run

1. Open `StaggerApp.xcodeproj` in **Xcode 16** (any 15.4+ should work).
2. Pick any iPhone simulator (iOS 17+; iOS 18+ recommended for the full `MeshGradient` aurora effects).
3. `Cmd-R`.

That's it — no SPM resolves, no third-party deps, no CocoaPods.

> **Note:** if the iOS 17 simulator on macOS produces a clipped layout (content appears in the left half of the screen), this is a known Xcode 16 / iOS 17 host display quirk unrelated to the app. Use an iOS 18 simulator (iPhone 16 / 16 Plus / 16 Pro) for a clean render.

## Architecture

MVVM + light Clean Architecture, single Xcode target.

### Dependency injection

`AppContainer` is the single composition root. It vends repositories (as protocols) and view-model factories:

```swift
// In RootView
DetailView(viewModel: container.makeDetailViewModel(animationId: id))
```

Every view model takes its dependencies via `init`. No singletons, no `@EnvironmentObject` for business logic — only for navigation state (`AppRouter`) and the container itself.

## State patterns

- **`@MainActor` view models** ensure UI updates stay on the main thread.
- **Combine** for search debouncing (`SearchViewModel.bind()`) and reactive favorites/purchases (`DetailViewModel`, `LibraryViewModel`).
- **`async/await` Tasks** drive looping preview animations (see `CorePreviews.swift`).
- **UserDefaults** persists favorites + purchase state. Swap with SwiftData behind the same protocol for production.

## Mesh gradients

The Aurora previews use `MeshGradient` on iOS 18+ and fall back to `LinearGradient` with `hueRotation` on iOS 17. See `CreativePreviews.AuroraMeshPreview` for the runtime version check.

## Animation previews

30 hand-coded SwiftUI animations across all categories (Backgrounds, Loaders, Buttons, Micro-interactions, Transitions, Navigation, Gestures, Onboarding, Text effects, Metal Shaders). All loop forever; none use third-party libraries (no Lottie / Rive).

## TODOs / Known limitations

- **Lab mode** (scrubbable knobs that feed back into the preview) — not implemented. The `LiveParametersPanel` sliders are visual-only.
- **Real StoreKit** — `PurchaseRepository.purchase(id:)` and `.subscribePro()` immediately flip in-memory state. A production app would integrate `StoreKit 2` behind the same protocol.
- **Recent activity** — the Library `Recent` tab uses a derived `Array(owned.prefix(3))`. A real activity log would be persisted on each detail view + copy event.
- **Liquid Ripple preview** — the published `CodeSamples.liquidRipple` references a Metal shader (`ripple`) that isn't bundled in this scope. The preview uses a SwiftUI ring approximation.
- **Tests** — no unit/UI tests included in this scope. The protocol-based DI is ready for them; add an `XCTest` target and wire fakes against `AnimationRepositoryProtocol`, `FavoritesRepositoryProtocol`, `PurchaseRepositoryProtocol`.
- **Accessibility** — basic labels and Dynamic Type are wired on the major atoms; full VoiceOver flow has not been exhaustively QA'd.

## Min iOS

- **Deployment target:** iOS 17.0
- **MeshGradient:** iOS 18+ (gracefully falls back on 17)
- **Xcode:** 16.0+
